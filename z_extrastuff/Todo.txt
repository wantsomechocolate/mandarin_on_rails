1.) Get active mail setup so that users work on GCP - I think this is actually working now!

2.) Make sure you actually complete the logic for transitioning guest users to actual users. 

2.5) Get flash messages or regular error messages working for devise guests

3.) Being able to mark known words

4.) Default markings based on settings

5.) Create job to delete old guest users

6.) Take a look at the devise and turbo drive redirects

7.) Load the trie and dict into memory when starting the application instead of doing it on every load. 

8.) Make tests?

My garbage and known words are being saved without trailing whitespace, but my shingles are stored that way
So somewhere along the line, the white space is being removed between the javascript->ajax->db
I think the best course of action is to make it so that all shingles have white space remoted anyway.
